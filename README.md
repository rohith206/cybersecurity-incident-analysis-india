# Cybersecurity Incident Analysis (India)

This project demonstrates a simple analysis of cybersecurity incidents across various Indian states from 2019 to 2023 using Python, Pandas, and NumPy.

Users can input a **state name** and **year**, and the system returns relevant information including:

- Type of Cyber Attack
- Target Sector
- Number of Records Lost

## 📊 Dataset Structure

The dataset is a manually created test sample and includes:

| Year | State        | Attack_Type | Target      | Records_Lost |
|------|--------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2020 | Maharashtra  | Phishing    | Individuals | 5000          |
| 2021 | Karnataka    | Ransomware  | Hospitals   | 30000         |
